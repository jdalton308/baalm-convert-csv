<p>We discussed how your skin has become increasingly oily since moving to a new state. Concerned with over drying out blemishes and getting enough hydration at the same time. We can definitely find a<br />
healthier balance with your skin routine by incorporating products/steps that will target the acne while providing hydration during the Winter months.</p>

<p><strong>Any problematic products/habits that I should stop?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. We noted that the Nivea face wash &amp; St. Ives scrub contain toxic chemicals, parabens &amp; sulfates.The scrub also has small jagged granules that could cause microscopic tears in the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Routine Recommendations:</strong></p>

<p><u>Serum</u> *Concentrated formula that goes on after cleansing &amp; before<br />
moisturizer-delivering powerful ingredients* 1x day or as needed<br />
when skin needs a boost. Okay to use current Glossier super pure<br />
serum til runs out.</p>

<p><u>Moisturizer</u> *Lightweight cream that helps skin retain moisture* (no<br />
spf) 1-2x day Option 1 www.eminenceorganics.com (clear skin<br />
probiotic moisturizer $60) Option 2 www.mychelle.com (clear skin<br />
balancing lotion $26)</p>

<p><u>Sunscreen</u> *Protects skin against damaging UVA &amp; UVB rays* Once<br />
or more per day (every 2 hours if in sun for long period of time)<br />
Option 1 www.imageskincare.com (Prevention daily matte oil free<br />
SPF 32- $40) Option 2 www.badgerbalm.com (Clear zinc unscented<br />
SPF 30- $20)</p>

Thank you for coming to me and trusting me with your skincare routine.</p>

<p>We discussed how you have an amazing base for your skincare routine. I really commend you on keeping your skin barrier moisturized and safe. That’s so important because it needs sufficient water to keep it healthy and balanced. Next step is to consistently add in a clay mask, exfoliating treatment, and daily salicylic acid treatment.</p>

<p>Over the next 3 weeks, please make note if you are seeing a reduction in non-hormonal acne, and are seeing brighter, less dull skin. Also, you want to watch out for any signs of irritation. Introduce your sunscreen first, then your salicylic acid serum a few days later, then the masks the following week.</p>

<p>Routine Recommendations:</p>

<p>1. Please try to apply your new sunscreen 2-3x a day normally -- and even more on days you are in direct sun exposure.</p>

<p>2. Use your hydrating mask 3x a week, overnight, as your last step over moisturizer.</p>

<p>3. Use your clay mask 1x a week, at night.</p>

<p>4. Use your exfoliating mask 2x a week, at night.</p>

<p>5. When doing your clay + exfoliating masks, cleanse your face first then apply, then wash off after 15-20 mins. Finish the rest of your routine, starting with your hydrating serum.</p>
